I'll update this later, it will be the descriptions of the player ini
files and what they are for.

Game uses the template.ini to work from. Change this file to your liking.
NOTE:
Until it is out of alpha/beta, these variables may change, so what you
change here, may not reflect on older players. I will try to make sure
that does not happen.

DEFINITIONS
- These are mixed as most of these are in the GAMESETTINGS.INI file.

o classId
    There are 3 types of classes in DEAD:
        - Tank(1),
        - DPS(2),
        - Healer(3)
    These are the most basic you'll find in most MMO's, and I follow
    the KISS format.
    
o classChance / classChanceOrig
    This is STATIC. Do not change. All players start with a 10% chance
    of success when using their special ability. Upon a successful
    attack, it in increased by "classInc". classChance is the running
    total, classChanceOrig is what they start with each classLevel.

o classXp
    Players get 1pt per successful hit on a Zombie (totalZKills). When
    players reach the "classLevelUp" threshold, they will get a new
    skill and start over with "classChanceOrig"

o classLevelUp
    How much xp per class level. see "classLevelUp.txt" for xp. change
    as needed.
